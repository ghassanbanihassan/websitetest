        <p style="color: white;">Amanda used our website to find a protective friend for <br> 
            her daughter that would be suitable for her apartment <br> 
            as well as her busy work life. We matched her with Oliver,<br>
            a labrador. Generally labradors are known to be a lovable <br>
            ,easy to train and maintain, alongside being a great <br>
            companion for children. They have since contacted us <br>
            expressing their gratitude for their new bestfriend.

            <p style="color: white;">This is Dave. He's been feeling lonely since <br>
                his kids moved out. We matched him with Axel <br>
                as he mentioned he has a lot of free time. <br>
                German shepherds are known to be highly energetic<br>
                and protective which matched up with Dave's quiz answers.</h2>
